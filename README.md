## Summary
### Drawback
There are limitations in this projet such as case sensitivity. The user needs to know the specific information in order to have an accurate output. The filter needs accurate and lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. 

### Recommendations:
- The next version of the website supposed to have trim property to get rid of spaces after the text automatically.

- The filter can be more specific by providing a range of the dates user needs to put their input.
